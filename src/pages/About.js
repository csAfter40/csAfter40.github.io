            <p>Hi there! I'm Muzaffer Barış Yavuz, a Software Developer and Mechanical Engineer based in Fethiye, Muğla, Turkey. During the curfew days of the COVID-19 pandemic, I started to learn programming as a way to keep myself busy and productive. As I began to learn more about programming, I fell in love with it and it became a passion for me. I decided to take my passion to the next level and enrolled in the Computer Programming Associates degree program at Ataturk University, from which I graduated.</p>
            <p>Now, I am looking to make a change in my career and start working in the software development field. I am extremely passionate about programming and I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to develop high-quality software applications. During my years working as a Mechanical Engineer, I also developed strong communication, teamwork, and other interpersonal skills that I can transfer to the software development field.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar and piano, walking in nature, and camping. I find these activities to be a great way to unwind and clear my mind. Additionally, I love watching conference talks, reading articles, listening to podcasts, and solving programming puzzles. I believe that continuing to learn and challenge myself outside of work helps me stay motivated and inspired.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my page!</p>
